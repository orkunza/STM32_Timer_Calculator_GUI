# STM32 Timer Calculator GUI
## Description

-STM32 Timer Calculator is a GUI-based application written in Python that allows users to calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the desired timer frequency and calculate the values for the prescaler and period registers. 
-The application has a release file in the EXE format, which allows it to be easily installed and run on Windows systems without the need for a Python interpreter.

## Purpose
The purpose of the STM32 Timer Calculator is to provide a tool for users to easily calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It aims to make it more convenient for users to set up the timer peripherals, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their project development. The generated C code feature also makes it easier for users to incorporate the timer configuration into their project, saving them time and effort. Overall, the STM32 Timer Calculator aims to streamline the process of setting up and configuring timer peripherals in STM32 projects.

## Usage
Finding the first 5 solutions for a Timer Event frequency of 1250 Hz. In addition the CRRx for a duty cycle of 12.5% are calculated. Timer base clock is 84Mhz
