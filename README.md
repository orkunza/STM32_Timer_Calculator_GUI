# STM32 Timer Calculator GUI 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èDescription
- STM32 Timer Calculator is a GUI based application written in Python that allows users to calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the desired timer frequency and calculate the values for the prescaler and period registers.
- The application has a release file in the EXE format, which allows it to be easily installed and run on Windows systems without the need for a Python interpreter.
- Overall, the STM32 Timer Calculator aims to streamline the process of setting up and configuring timer peripherals in STM32 projects, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their project development.

</p>

To use the STM32 Timer Calculator, the user will need to first install the application by running the EXE file. Once the application is installed, the user can launch it and follow the steps below:

- Write the desired timer frequency in the designated field. 
- Write the clock source frequency from your microcontroller.
- Click the "Calculate" button to compute the values for the prescaler and period registers.
- The calculated values will be displayed in the designated field.
- PSC is your Prescaler values.
- ARR is your Counter Period (AutoReload Register) values.
The user can then use the calculated values to set up and configure the timer peripherals in their STM32 project.
