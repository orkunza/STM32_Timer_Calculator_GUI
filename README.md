## ‚ÑπÔ∏èDescription

- STM32 Timer Calculator is a GUI-based application written in Python that allows users to calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the desired timer frequency and calculate the values for the prescaler and period registers. 
- The application has a release file in the EXE format, which allows it to be easily installed and run on Windows systems without the need for a Python interpreter.
                   
The purpose of the STM32 Timer Calculator is to provide a tool for users to easily calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It aims to make it more convenient for users to set up the timer peripherals, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their project development. The generated C code feature also makes it easier for users to incorporate the timer configuration into their project, saving them time and effort. Overall, the STM32 Timer Calculator aims to streamline the process of setting up and configuring timer peripherals in STM32 projects.
                    
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èUsage 
To use the STM32 Timer Calculator, the user will need to first install the application by running the EXE file. Once the application is installed, the user can launch it and follow the steps below:

- Input the desired timer frequency in the designated field.
- Choose the desired timer clock source from the dropdown menu.
- Click the "Calculate" button to compute the values for the prescaler and period registers.
- The calculated values will be displayed in the designated fields.
- If desired, the user can also click the "Generate C Code" button to generate C code that can be used in their project to configure the timer with the calculated values.
The user can then use the calculated values to set up and configure the timer peripherals in their STM32 project.
