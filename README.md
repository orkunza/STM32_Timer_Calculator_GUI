# STM32 Timer Calculator GUI
## Description

STM32 Timer Calculator is a GUI-based application written in Python that allows users to calculate the values needed to configure the timer peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the desired timer frequency and calculate the values for the prescaler and period registers. 
The application has a release file in the EXE format, which allows it to be easily installed and run on Windows systems without the need for a Python interpreter.

## Purpose
I programmed this little program because of my bachelor thesis. 
There was no tool to calculate the specific frequency of the output frequency generated by PWM for any microcontroller.


Finding the first 5 solutions for a Timer Event frequency of 1250 Hz. In addition the CRRx for a duty cycle of 12.5% are calculated. Timer base clock is 84Mhz
