STM32 Timer Calculator GUI

## Description

Calculator for STM32 to calculate the frequency of a sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PWM)

## Purpose
I programmed this little program because of my bachelor thesis. 
There was no tool to calculate the specific frequency of the output frequency generated by PWM for any microcontroller.
